# Kalculator
It's a Kalculator but with a 'K'.

# Motivation
I have always wanted to create a GUI (in Rust specifically), and a calculator.
And this was the best way to do the best of both worlds.

# Development
You can look at the development of Kalculator in my
[twitch](https://www.twitch.com/cerenitty), and follow along on my [blog](https://hashnode.com/preview/60b22eeefb51fd32a4dc0907).
