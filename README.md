# Kalculator
A calculator made in C++ with operator precedence.

# Limitations
I will work on removing these limitations.
1. Operation on non single digit integers.

Currently this only works for digits 0 to 9. 10 is interpreted as 1 and 0. 11 is interpreted as 1 and 1. They are interpreted individually instead of as a whole.

2. Exponents and parenthesis are not supported.
